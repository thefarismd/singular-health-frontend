## Notes

- Ensure the backend server (`singular-health-backend`) is running and accessible at `http://localhost:5266` before testing the application.
- 
## Assumptions & Trade-offs

- Patient scan is hardcoded â€” the app only supports a single patient's scan records.

## Estimated Time Spent

- 2.5 Hours
